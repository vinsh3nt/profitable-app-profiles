    "## Intro\n",
    "The aim of this project is to analyze data from the Apple App store and Google Play store to find profitable app profiles. The goal is to identify which apps could be more likely to attract more users. We are interested specifically in free apps. The idea is that by doing this analysis we can determine what kind of app to develop that could have a chance of doing well on both the Apple and Android app stores.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Opening the Files\n",
    "\n",
    "As of September 2018 there were approximately 2 million iOS apps and 2.1 million Android apps on their respective stores. We will be looking at a sample of this as analyzing over 2 million data points is a bit overkill.\n",
    "\n",
    "The datasets we will be using are:\n",
    "* [A data set](https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps) with data on ~10,000 Android apps. The data was scraped in August 2018. The dataset can be downloaded directly [here](https://dq-content.s3.amazonaws.com/350/googleplaystore.csv).\n",
    "* [A data set](https://www.kaggle.com/ramamet4/app-store-apple-data-set-10k-apps) with data on ~7000 iOS apps, the data was scraped in July 2017. It can be downloaded [here](https://dq-content.s3.amazonaws.com/350/AppleStore.csv).\n",
